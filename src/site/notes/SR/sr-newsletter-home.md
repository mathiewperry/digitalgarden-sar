> [!question] What Is This & Who Is It For ?  
> - this is a curated medical / personal newsletter I write and post at the end of each month.
> - There is a lot of stuff i read about each month and would like to share it with you, my dear online reader!
> - This Newsletter is intended for medical students, health care providers and any online visiter who would like to see what's new in this website.
> - I made this newsletter specifically hosted on the open web to avoid any annoying social media feeds or ads and there is No attention stealing notifications ! You can just bookmark this webpage and offload it in your mobile browser and read the newsletter whenever you have time. 
> - LLMs AI are growing and expanding each day, taking over the online writing world (it seems like it), so this newsletter is written by me (trust me I'm a human not an AI! LOL) and whenever I need to use an LLM you'll see a footnote telling you what I used it for ie. text (formatting / rephrasing).
