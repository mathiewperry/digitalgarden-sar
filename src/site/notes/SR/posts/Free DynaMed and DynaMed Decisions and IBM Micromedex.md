> [!tip] Summary 
> DynaMed is an evidence-based, point-of-care clinical database containing over 2,000 concise disease summaries commonly encountered in primary care, designed to offer quick, reliable, and up-to-date medical information. Free access can be obtained either by repeatedly requesting monthly free trials or, more reliably, by registering for a free ACP (American College of Physicians) medical-student membership, which grants one year of complimentary DynaMed access through the ACP portal; older methods such as applying via HINARI no longer work.

## How To Get it for Free?
There are Two Proven Ways of getting it, and one that did not work for me .
1.  Requesting Free Trial for a month then at the end of every you have to request another one from using new account. It is inconvenience but id does work. Request Trial [Here](https://www.dynamed.com/store/free-trial)
2. One  Year activated free account through ACP (American College of Physicians) Free account. 
3. as [Dr.Anas](https://www.dranas.pk/2022/01/get-dyna-med-free-access.html) Puts it: " they (doctors based in developing countries) can directly apply to DYNA Med for free access via The Health Internetwork Access to Research Initiative (HINARI) effort which aims to provide clinical support tools to doctors in developing countries. To apply in the program, you will have to email your details and brief biodata along-with request for free access at [info@dynamicmedical.com](mailto:info@dynamicmedical.com) "

> [!warning] DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE!
> -  I tried it .It did not work out .I couldn't even send an email to this address.
