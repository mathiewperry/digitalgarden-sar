> [!tip] In This Month !
> - This month was heavy on surgery rotation, surgery osce exam is within days from now, wish me GL 🤞... 
> - Key Takeaway :
> 	- believe it or not all that plastics inside your body might be a risk factor for heart disease ! see (Literature Corner)
> 	- Case Based Learning & Real-Situational Teaching for med students is so far the best Method to Learn Medicine (imo).
> 	- Treat any irreducible, tender groin lump in a patient with vomiting as a strangulated hernia until proven otherwise, regardless of "hardness."

## Clinical Corner 

- A 72F pt. came to the ED with Colicky abdominal pain & vomiting for 24 hrs. she states that the pain is Severe and "It Just Hurts Everywhere". O/E The abdomen is distended with diffuse tenderness but no board-like rigidity. On the right groin, below the inguinal ligament, there is a small, firm, tender lump roughly 2 cm in size. The lump feels remarkably hard and tense & -Ve expansile cough impulse. the lump didn't transilluminate either, so the student examining the pt. excluded hernia from his ddx due to -ve cough impulse and made the provisional dx is Lymphadenopathy (**Cloquet’s Node**) his plan was discharge with Antibiotics .

- IF this pt. in this scenario was let go home on Abs, She Would Most definitely  come back with gangrenous bowel ! because this is a strangulated Femoral Hernia (Most likely).

- In strangulation, the neck is plugged, blocking the transmission of intra-abdominal pressure, so cough impulse is -Ve.

> Take away here is that Treat any irreducible, tender groin lump in a patient with vomiting as a strangulated hernia until proven otherwise, regardless of "hardness."

## Resource Corner 

- This month I found a free resource website called [Operative Review](https://operativereview.com/) which is a High Yield Short Article formatted Review of Surgical Topics Written by Surgeons and doctors (Not AI). 
- I used it when i wanted a quick (15 mins) review of a surgical topic or procedure whenever i don't time to review the whole topic. It has received the 2023 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) David C. Leach award  for Annovation in Medical Education. [^3] 
- imo, it is easily one of my top 10 surgery learning resources. Its High Yield, useful text, easy to read and supplemented with EBM.

## Literature Corner 

- i found out about this paper titled "Microplastics and Nanoplastics in Atheromas and Cardiovascular Events" [^1] from youtube video by Dr. [[Mel Herbert\|Mel Herbert]]. [^2] 
- so basically the Answer right now is **NO You don't get a stroke or MI from all there plastics your body is exposed to on a daily basis**, BUT it could be a risk factor for ACS.

##### Microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) & cardiovascular events ? 


?
- So far No Causation Has been definitely confirmed ! 
- as of 2024 prospective study of 257 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, those with MNPs detected in their carotid artery plaque had a **4.5-fold higher risk** (hazard ratio 4.53; 95% CI, 2.00-10.27) of experiencing myocardial infarction, stroke, or death over 34 months of follow-up compared to those without detectable MNPs. [^1]
- MNPs contribute to cardiovascular disease through multiple pathways : 
	- **Endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage**: MNPs induce endothelial cell toxicity and compromise vascular barrier integrity. [^2]
	- **Atherosclerosis promotion**: They disrupt lipid metabolism, promote foam cell formation, and facilitate smooth muscle cell migration. [^2] [^4]
	- **Inflammatory activation**: MNPs activate systemic inflammation, inflammasomes, and modulate cytokine secretion. [^5] [^6]
	- **Oxidative stress and cellular injury**: They promote oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and myocardial fibrosis. [^5] [^6] [^7] [^3]
	- **Prothrombotic effects**: MNPs alter coagulation dynamics, promote thrombus formation, and increase platelet aggregation.  [^2] [^8] [^9]
- Polyethylene was detected in the plaque in over half of the pts. while polyvinyl chloride was found in 12% of them.[^1]
 P.S. [[journals/2026-01-17\|2026-01-17]] Got across this thanks to Dr. [[Mel Herbert\|Mel Herbert]] video : [Nano Plastics and Heart attacks and strokes!](https://youtu.be/W0sBS7_2n1g?t=99) this is the study : Marfella, Raffaele, et al. “Microplastics and Nanoplastics in Atheromas and Cardiovascular Events.” _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 390, no. 10, Mar. 2024, pp. 900–10. _DOI.org (Crossref)_, https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822.

## Discussion Corner 

- from little clinical exposure i got this month, I noticed lack of adequate Hx taking & Physical Exam, Why Do Think that is the case in our hospitals? 

- (imo) it's due to many factors, most important one would be overconfidence & Carelessness by the examiner. In addition to that, experienced consultants often use "short-cut" methods for examination based on pattern recognition. Students sometimes mimic this "spot diagnosis" approach. However, this is inherently dangerous, we should use standard, exhaustive routines to avoid missing pathology. Disagree with me, Great !
